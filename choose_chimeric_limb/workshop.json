  "Title": "Choose Chimeric Limb Subtype",
  "Description": "While the general class of limb (head, legs, etc.) is still randomly determined, the player will be prompted to select a specific limb under that category. This is primarily for flavor, although the different subtypes do have different materials (flesh, plant matter, bone), which could become relevant in the future.",
